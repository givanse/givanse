## Newsletter

If you were to take away a single thing from this post I would like it to be the
[Ember Weekly](http://emberweekly.com/)
newsletter, subscribe to it and you'll get a nice update on Ember things every Sunday.

## Chat about it 

There are lots of folks giving help and asking for help in the 
Freenode IRC channels `#emberjs` and `#ember-cli`. Just:

    /join #emberjs
    /join #ember-cli

Recently an Ember community Slack was created, you can get your invite here 
[ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com](https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/)
and after registering you'll login here: [embercommunity.slack.com](https://embercommunity.slack.com/)

You'll find over 30 channels, some of them are:

 * &#35;jobs 
 * &#35;announcements
 * &#35;needhelp

## Forums and websites

The [Ember.js discussion forum](http://discuss.emberjs.com/) is pretty much 
the official Ember forums. The reasons are:

 * Its an Ember app, an instance of [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/).
 * Discourse has evolved along with Ember, it was [first announced in early 2013](http://eviltrout.com/2013/02/10/why-discourse-uses-emberjs.html).
 * The forums admins are [@pwagenet](http://discuss.emberjs.com/users/pwagenet/activity), [@tomdale](http://discuss.emberjs.com/users/tomdale/activity) and [@wycats](http://discuss.emberjs.com/users/wycats/activity), all of them Ember core team members.

Of course you'll also find Ember topics in stablished websites, follow the subreddit 
[/r/emberjs](https://www.reddit.com/r/emberjs) and the Stack Overflow tags
[ember.js](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ember.js) and
[ember-cli](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ember-cli).

If you want to see how the sausage is made, watch the
[Ember RFC repository](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs).
That is the place where you suggest and discuss new features or big changes for the framework. 

## Twitter

The hashtag used for Ember tweets is [#emberjs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/emberjs),
I know, big shock.

There are some accounts that were create to track what is happening around Ember, check them out:

 * [@EmberSherpa](https://twitter.com/EmberSherpa)
 * [@emberflare_com](https://twitter.com/emberflare_com)
 * [@BuiltWithEmber](https://twitter.com/BuiltWithEmber)

Every Ember event or meet up has their own Twitter account, some of them:

 * [@WickedGoodEmber](https://twitter.com/WickedGoodEmber)
 * [@BostonEmber](https://twitter.com/BostonEmber)

Yeah, there is a lot of tweeting going on around Ember.
