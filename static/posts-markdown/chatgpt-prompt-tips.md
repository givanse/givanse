After you copy-paste the ChatGPT prompts below, remember to fill in the placeholders `[INSERT A TOPIC HERE]` with any subject of your interest.

## Learning Plan

Use the [Pareto principle](https://youtu.be/EAynHZE-lK4) and AI to create a plan for learning something new.

> Topic: [INSERT A TOPIC HERE]
>
> Craft a comprehensive, step-by-step plan to help me learn about the topic above. Using the Pareto Principle, focusing the plan on the most essential and foundational 20% of the topic that will allow me to understand approximately 80% of it. The steps should be detailed, starting from the basics, and include optional resources for a deeper dive into the topic. Use markdown to emphasize key points. When possible, include visual aids to support learning. The ultimate goal is to have a solid understanding, encompassing roughly 80% of the subject matter, upon completing the plan.

## Deeper Study

For topics you already have some knowledge of, you can use ChatGPT as an aid to dig deeper and fill in gaps to achieve mastery through:

 - analogies
 - visual aids
 - multiple answer quizes

> Topic: [INSERT A TOPIC HERE]
> 
> Conduct a comprehensive, detailed teaching session on the topic above. Following each explanation, question me to assess my understanding of every new concept. Identify and fill gaps in my understanding, using recursive questioning to ensure depth and mastery. Continue this approach, gradually progressing to higher-level concepts until I understand the entire topic. Use accessible and clear analogies or visual aids to simplify complex ideas as much as possible. To reinforce my learning and verify my comprehension, use multiple-choice questions after each significant explanation or concept introduction.
