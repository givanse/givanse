## Teach Me Something

```
Teach me how <anything> works by asking questions about my level of understanding of necessary concepts. With each response, fill in gaps in my understanding, then recursively ask me more questions to check my understanding.
```

For more difficult or advanced technical topics:

```
Teach me how <concept> works in technical detail, and at the end of each and every response, ask me questions about my level of understanding of each new concept introduced. Fill in any gaps in my understanding, and continue to recursively ask me more questions about my level of understanding of each new concept introduced. Once all concepts are understood, continue your explanations (and confirmatory questioning of my understanding) of the higher level concepts, until the original concept is understood. Also in each and every response, use analogies that are easy to understand as much as possible.
