    <h2>Color codes</h2>

    <p>
      Different boxes have different colors, each color corresponds to a 
      definition of the term <b>Controller</b>.
      Model and View, although their definitions sometimes vary a little, they are usually well understood.
      The Controller is the one that can be confusing.
